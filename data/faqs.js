    q: "Why do I need your help to find and join a Medicare plan?",
    a: `Even highly educated people routinely report that they find enrolling in Medicare to be a confusing and frustrating process. Some people enroll in Medicare incorrectly and end up with lifetime financial penalties or get stuck with a choice that may not work best for their particular situation. Some Medicare choices, once selected, cannot be reversed. Many people come to me after doing hours of their own research on Medicare and are still confused and unsure about what their best options might be. I am very familiar with the Medicare choices in Maryland and the Greater Baltimore Area and can save you a substantial amount of time (and often money) as you search for the best plan for YOUR situation.`

    q: "Won’t my Medicare card (Part A & Part B) coverage be enough?",
    a: `Your Medicare card (Part A & Part B; referred to as “Original Medicare”) does provide important coverage for medical expenses but they have significant gaps that can potentially lead to huge medical bills that will be your financial responsibility. To fill these gaps you will need to purchase additional coverage from a private insurance company; either a Medicare supplement insurance plan (also known as Medigap coverage) or a Medicare Advantage plan. You are also required to have a Part D Prescription drug plan which can be purchased from a private insurance company. You must have a Part D prescription drug plan even if you don’t take any prescriptions!`

    q: "How much will your help cost me?",
    a: `Filling the gaps of Original Medicare requires purchasing either a Medigap insurance plan or Medicare Advantage plan from private insurance companies that charge a premium to join. The premium you pay will be exactly the same if you do your own (likely many hours) research and comparisons or if you allow me to do the searching for you and suggest the plans that given your stated goals and situation should be – based on my years of experience – the best fit for you. If you select an insurance plan and I help to enroll you, then the insurance company pays me a commission which is how I make a living (and is my kids’ favorite part of dad’s career). The education and guidance I provide are free; I get compensated if you choose to enroll with a company I have suggested for you. I typically suggest 2 to 4 alternatives for your consideration (for more complete and secure Medicare coverage).`

    q: "Why should I work with you instead of enrolling directly with a particular Medicare insurance company?",
    a: `If you call a Medicare provider directly they will make every effort to enroll you in their plan whether or not it is truly the best fit for you. As an independent insurance agent, I represent many insurance companies who offer both Medigap and Medicare Advantage Plans (and Part D drug plans) and I can tailor a plan to fit your specific requirements.`

    q: "Why should I enroll with you vs. enrolling with one of the large Medicare insurance agencies I see on TV or YouTube?",
    a: `Those companies will likely do a decent job. Here’s the difference; First and foremost, I give a damn. I don’t take it lightly that people trust me to find the best healthcare coverage for their particular situation. Choosing the right healthcare plan for one’s own exact needs is among the most important decisions we make – especially in our senior years. I am local and I choose to work only in Maryland. I know the plans available in Maryland extremely well and can suggest the 2 or 3 plans that, based on my experience, will fit your requirements the best. Unlike the bigger agencies, I can help seniors determine if they are eligible for any of the state, federal or corporate programs that can help low and moderate income seniors save money on their Medicare premiums, insurance premiums and/or prescription plans. If Medicare applicants are eligible, I am happy to help them enroll in the appropriate assistance plan that will save them money on their Healthcare. I am available to answer your questions (either now or in the future), and as many of the seniors I’ve helped enroll in Medicare plans can tell you, I will often follow up with you weeks after you’ve signed up to see if you have questions and to see how the plan is working for you. Please check out the client testimonial page for some specifics. Most people give me positive feedback and seem to like working with me.`

    q: "How do I know that you will provide me with the most competitive (cheapest) Medicare plan premium quotes?",
    a: `All licensed agents have access to pretty much the same companies and plans. I do my best to find the Medicare plans that will offer the most robust healthcare coverage at the lowest cost. I have entered specific quotes offered by some of the large national Medicare agencies to the searches that I often do for the same coverage. Sometimes the results are the same (if it’s the same carrier) and sometimes (even often) I may quote a different company (with top ratings) that beats the national agency’s quotes by 15 to 22% (on average). Some of the Medicare Advantage plans have low-cost, sometimes even $0 premium per month plans and this is a frequently suggested option (depending on what the enrollee is looking for).`
