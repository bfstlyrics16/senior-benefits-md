    text: `As my wife and I approached retirement, we began looking into Medicare and the various “gap” plans that supplement it. My background as a librarian and data scientist, coupled with my wife’s knowledge of healthcare from her career as a registered nurse, made us formidable researchers. In spite of my wife's healthcare knowledge and my research background, we still found understanding our options for Medicare very confusing. The first thing you realize about Medicare and the private plans to supplement its coverage is that it’s absurdly complicated. Consequently, after hours of research, and encountering numerous contradictions in the system, we still had numerous questions.

We approached David with a sense of what we wanted to do but with some unease about our decision making. David sent us some information about Medicare which made the whole Medicare concept much more understandable. He also spent some time with us and answered all of our questions. David presented several alternatives for our Medicare coverage but we had already selected a plan that we liked. David confirmed that it was a good choice and helped us enroll. We found that this plan fit our needs very comprehensively at a price we could afford.

David was very patient and knowledgeable about the Medicare landscape and he really simplified the research process for us. He presented a few different alternatives and left the choice up to us. We had no doubts about his integrity and desire to do well for his clients.`

    text: `I attended a Medicare Simplified workshop a few months back, prior to me turning 65, to educate myself about Medicare. Not knowing anything going in, the class left me well informed. I later met with the workshop instructor, David Wagenheim, and he walked me through all of my options for Medicare based on my specific needs. Once I was enrolled in the plan of my choice David kept in touch with me to be sure that everything was being addressed. David continued to follow up with me for several weeks after I enrolled to be sure that my new Medicare plan was meeting my healthcare needs. I couldn’t be more pleased. HUGE SHOUT OUT TO DAVID FOR ALWAYS BEING THERE!`

    text: `It was a happy accident to find Mr. David Wagenheim as a Medicare Navigator after I attended a free class he gave at my local library. I'm a caretaker for my brother who only had Medicare Part A & B and needed info and guidance on what other options are available, and what benefit discounts he might be qualified for.

Mr. David stepped in and assisted at my request and provided what my brother (whom can be very cantankerous at times) needed. Mr. David has proven to be persistent in getting any and all information that will better a consumer's circumstance with any Medicare dilemma. He is consistent and patient. He writes and calls when he says he's going to and shows up on time if he says he will meet with you. I can say my experience was positive and do recommend his services.`

    text: `I found joining Medicare to be a very confusing experience. David Wagenheim really helped me understand how it all works and simplified the search process for me. He gave me several options including the very competitive one that I selected. I've had several questions after I signed up and David has always gotten back to me quickly with the answers that I needed, even many months after I initially signed up. I would definitely recommend working with David Wagenheim as he made the whole process easy and understandable and has been responsive whenever I've reached out.`

    text: `Having been on Medicare for some time, I was unsure if I was getting the best benefits available, and frankly, I found the whole Medicare process pretty confusing. I attended a "Medicare Simplified" workshop, and for the first time, I felt that I could now understand my Medicare options and how the whole Medicare system works. The workshop presenter, David Wagenheim, met with me and took some time to learn about my situation and how I was currently set up for Medicare healthcare coverage. After reviewing my existing Medicare set-up, David presented several options. I picked the option he thought fit my situation best, and indeed, the new Medicare plan gave me far richer benefits than I had previously, with no additional expense.

A few months down the line, I found that I was having difficulty accessing some of the benefits offered by my Medicare plan. David was very proactive in following up with me and helping me to communicate with the plan to receive the benefits that I needed and that the plan promised. It took a while, but I eventually did get the benefits I needed. David proactively checked in with me several times during this time period to offer his help and to make sure that I was getting the results I needed.

David helped me understand how Medicare works, he helped me enroll in a plan that gave me far richer benefits for no additional cash outlay, and he proactively followed up with me (for several weeks) when I had a challenge getting some of the benefits promised to me by my Medicare plan. I would definitely recommend David Wagenheim for help with understanding Medicare, and for help finding the best Medicare plan for a person's particular situation.`

    text: `As I approached my 65th birthday, I knew that I needed to figure out Medicare. I had heard that it is confusing, there can be penalties if you sign up incorrectly, and that it's basically an expensive pain in the neck. I tried reading the government's "Medicare and You" book but found that although it described Part A and Part B and Part D of Medicare as well as Medicare Advantage Plans and Medigap plans, it didn't really explain the pros and cons of each approach. I found David Wagenheim/Senior Benefit Solutions online and we first had a phone conversation.

David emailed me his free Medicare Basics 101 article and it made the whole process much easier to understand. At an in-person meeting, David further explained the pros and cons of Medigap insurance vs. Medicare Advantage plans and he had multiple quotes for me for each Medicare approach. David enrolled me in a plan I was very happy with at a lower premium than I expected. The best part was that he did all of the research for me, he helped me fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of each Medicare strategy, and he brought me several quotes and suggestions for each approach. David made the process of joining Medicare easy to understand and easy to sign up for. I would definitely recommend getting his help when signing up for Medicare.`
